# ER Diagram Workshop â€“ Submission Template

## Objective
To understand and apply ER modeling concepts by creating ER diagrams for real-world applications.

## Purpose
Gain hands-on experience in designing ER diagrams that represent database structure including entities, relationships, attributes, and constraints.



# Scenario C: Restaurant Table Reservation & Ordering

**Business Context:**  
A popular restaurant wants to manage reservations, orders, and billing.

**Requirements:**  
- Customers can reserve tables or walk in.  
- Each reservation includes date, time, and number of guests.  
- Customers place food orders linked to reservations.  
- Each order contains multiple dishes; dishes belong to categories (starter, main, dessert).  
- Bills generated per reservation, including food and service charges.  
- Waiters assigned to serve reservations.
